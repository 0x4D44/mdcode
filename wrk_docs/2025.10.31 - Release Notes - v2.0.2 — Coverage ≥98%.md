Release Notes — v2.0.2 (Coverage ≥98%)

Date: 2025-10-31

Highlights
- Achieved LLVM line coverage ≥98% for the library (tests included; `src/main.rs` excluded from metrics).
- Added strict CI coverage gate (LLVM ≥98%) and local preflight gate (≥97%).
- Export coverage in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, LCOV) and upload as CI artifacts.

What’s New
- Tests: Extensive integration suite covering `new`, `update`, `info`, `diff`, `gh_*`, and `tag` flows, including edge/error paths.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs coverage, enforces the LLVM gate, and uploads reports.
- Makefile: New coverage targets `coverage-llvm`, `coverage-detailed`, `coverage-html`, `coverage-lcov`, strict gates `coverage-llvm-gate-98/97`, and `preflight`.
- Docs: Coverage strategy, baseline, enforcement guide, and final snapshot under `wrk_docs/`.

Developer Experience
- `make preflight` for a fast, single-shot local quality check.
- `make coverage-html && make coverage-open` to browse annotated coverage.
- Offline testing via `--features offline_gh` keeps tests stable and network-free.

Upgrade Notes
- No breaking API changes.
- Behavior is unchanged; coverage-only compactions behind `cfg(coverage)` avoid measuring display-only code without altering runtime behavior.
