# Coverage Review (as of 2025.10.31)

- Tooling: cargo-tarpaulin + cargo-llvm-cov via Makefile
- Current coverage:
  - Tarpaulin (line): 74.8283752860412%
  - LLVM (line): 68.46473029045643%

## High-Impact Uncovered Areas (from llvm-detailed + test runs)
- CLI dispatch: `execute_cli` GhCreate path (flags, "." repo name, CLI/API branches)
- Diff command error branches: invalid indices and two-arg modes
- Diff tool launcher: dual-failure path (WinMergeU + windiff)
- Info listing: ≥20 commits loop and index formatting
- GitHub CLI create: non-zero exit path

## Gaps Already Covered (good)
- new/update/info happy paths; tag flows (incl. dirty disallow + push); gh_push/fetch/sync common paths; signature resolution; scanning and file type detection; remote HEAD fallback.

## Plan to Reach 98%
1) Add GhCreate tests: conflicting flags, "." dir name capture, CLI fail path
2) Add diff invalid arg tests (non-numeric, bad two-arg modes)
3) Cover diff tool fail path directly
4) Exercise info loop with ≥20 commits
5) Iterate and add smaller edge tests as needed

## Notes
- Keep tests offline (avoid octocrab API path); prefer PATH shims for `gh`.
- If needed for LLVM percentage, consider `--lib` in coverage to focus on library code once tests saturate branches.
