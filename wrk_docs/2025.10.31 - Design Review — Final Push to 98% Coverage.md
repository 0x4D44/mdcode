# Design Review â€” Final Push to 98% Coverage

Date: 2025-10-31
Reviewer: Coverage Track

## Scope Reviewed
- Test additions only: `tests/gh_cli_path_ok.rs`, `tests/gh_create_internal_flag.rs`.
- No production code change; coverage-only guards unchanged.

## Findings
- The PATH shim approach is consistent with prior tests and keeps `gh_cli_path()` and `execute_cli(GhCreate)` deterministic.
- The Internal visibility branch in `execute_cli` is now exercised, lifting a previously uncovered line (L279).
- `gh_cli_path()` success case is exercised without requiring a real GitHub CLI.
- Windows-only fallbacks remain unmeasured on Unix; acceptable per goals.

## Risks / Issues
- None functionally. A few test warnings (non-snake-case names, unused imports) are benign but could be cleaned up later.

## Decision
- Approved as-is. Meets acceptance criteria without altering runtime behavior.

## Verification
- `make coverage-detailed` now reports 98.35% lines (477/485) for `src/lib.rs`.
- All tests pass locally under coverage configuration.
