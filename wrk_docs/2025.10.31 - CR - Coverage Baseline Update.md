Coverage Baseline Update

Date: 2025-10-31

Summary
- Updated `coverage_baseline.toml` to reflect the new steady-state LLVM coverage.

Changes
- `baseline.llvm_line`: 55.83 → 98.47
- `baseline.tarpaulin_line`: unchanged (43.49). Tarpaulin remains optional in CI; local `make coverage` still runs it by default.
- `threshold.max_drop`: unchanged (5.0). This allows up to a 5 percentage-point temporary dip from the baseline for local development runs governed by `scripts/coverage_gate.py`.

Rationale
- The repository now consistently achieves ≥98% LLVM line coverage (see: `wrk_docs/2025.10.31 - CR - Final Coverage Snapshot.md`). Elevating the baseline ensures the local coverage guard reflects current expectations and prevents regressions over time.

Operational Notes
- CI enforces a stricter LLVM gate (≥98%) independently via `make coverage-llvm-gate-98`.
- For quicker local iteration, use `make preflight` (97% LLVM gate) or `COVERAGE_SKIP_TARPAULIN=1 COVERAGE_OPTIONAL_TARPAULIN=1 make coverage`.
