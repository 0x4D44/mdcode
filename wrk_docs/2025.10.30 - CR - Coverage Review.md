Title: mdcode Coverage Review — 2025-10-30

Summary
- Baseline (2025-10-22): Tarpaulin 43.49% line; LLVM-cov 55.83% line, 55.84% region, 59.22% function.
- Latest report (2025-10-22 update): Tarpaulin 85.88% line; LLVM-cov 89.54% line, 87.54% region, 89.87% function.
- Current test suite: 67 unit tests pass locally (`cargo test`), exercising core CLI flows, Git operations (init, add, commit, push/fetch/sync), tagging, diff orchestration, file-type detection, and error handling in many commands.

Sources Reviewed
- reports/coverage/2025-10-22.md — baseline metrics and gaps.
- reports/coverage/2025-10-22-coverage-update.md — post-expansion metrics and deltas.
- coverage_baseline.toml — gate configuration (baseline + max_drop).
- scripts/coverage_gate.py — enforces regression thresholds using Tarpaulin JSON and LLVM-cov summary JSON.
- src/main.rs — all production code and unit tests (single-crate binary).

What’s Well Covered
- CLI dispatch and argument validation for the primary subcommands (`new`, `update`, `info`, `diff`, `gh_*`, `tag`).
- Repository lifecycle: initialization, staging, committing, tagging, and pushing to a temporary bare remote.
- Diff orchestration: index selection, H/L modes, and custom diff tool via env var.
- Robust file classification (`detect_file_type`) with extensive extension and special-filename coverage.
- Scanning helpers (`scan_total_files`, `scan_source_files`) including size thresholds, .gitignore honoring, and excluded path filters.
- GitHub flows: CLI path happy-path, API fallback via test stub, push paths with and without skip env, flag conflict handling.
- Error surfaces: missing repos, empty repos, invalid diff indexes, merge-conflict guidance on failed pull, detached HEAD on push.

Primary Gaps Observed
- Program launch utility coverage:
  - `launch_program_with_args` is exercised only via higher-level fallbacks; direct success/failure paths lack explicit tests.
  - `launch_custom_diff_tool` has only negative-spec coverage.
- GitHub CLI detection:
  - `gh_cli_path` disable-path (`MDCODE_DISABLE_GH_CLI`) and PATH-based detection matrix not fully isolated in unit tests.
- Low-frequency error paths:
  - `get_last_commit` on repos without commits (explicit negative)
  - `checkout_tree_to_dir` deep recursion and blob write confirmation via a direct invocation
  - `gh_fetch` log subcommand failure branch (difficult to simulate without shadowing git for part of the function)

Risk/Cost Notes
- Network access is not required; tests use local temporary repos and bare remotes.
- Windows-specific branches (e.g., WinMergeU, where/Program Files probes) are conditionally compiled and remain uncovered on non-Windows CI — acceptable trade-off.
- Entry `main()` is compiled to a no-op under `#[cfg(tarpaulin)]`, so Tarpaulin does not penalize it.

Recommendations
1) Add focused unit tests that directly target `launch_program_with_args` success/failure and `launch_custom_diff_tool` success.
2) Add `gh_cli_path` disable-path coverage; retain existing PATH-detection coverage via CLI end-to-end test.
3) Exercise `checkout_tree_to_dir` against a real tree with nested structure to verify recursion and blob writes.
4) Add explicit tests for `get_last_commit` on empty and non-empty repos.
5) Optionally pursue synthetic failure fixtures for `gh_fetch`’s `git log` failure, but weigh complexity vs. marginal coverage gain.

Target and Next Steps
- Target: ≥98% line coverage (Tarpaulin) by covering the above “cold” utilities and error cases.
- Execute the attached multi-stage plan (saved alongside this report) and re-run `make coverage` to verify thresholds.

Local Validation (2025-10-30)
- `cargo test` passes locally: 67 tests; 0 failed; ~0.3s in this environment.
- Coverage tools (tarpaulin/llvm-cov) are configured in `Makefile`, but may require the developer toolchains to be installed to re-generate reports.
