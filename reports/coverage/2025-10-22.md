# 2025-10-22 Coverage Baseline

## Commands
- `cargo tarpaulin --out Json`
- `cargo llvm-cov --summary-only`

## Results
- **Tarpaulin**: 43.49 % line coverage (374/860 lines) captured in `tarpaulin-report.json`.
- **LLVM-cov**: 55.83 % line coverage, 55.84 % region coverage, 59.22 % function coverage (stdout summary).

## Notes
- Major gaps come from the CLI dispatcher (`run` manifesting uncovered matches) and the diff/GitHub helper functions (`diff_command`, `launch_diff_tool`, `gh_fetch`, `gh_sync`).
- GitHub create flows (CLI and API) remain untested, as does error handling for mutually exclusive visibility flags.
- Diff tooling paths and dry-run vs. commit logic have minimal coverage beyond repository setup helpers.
